# TURN listener port for TLS (Default: 5349).
# Note: actually, "plain" TCP & UDP sessions can connect to the TLS & DTLS
# port(s), too - if allowed by configuration. The TURN server
# "automatically" recognizes the type of traffic. Actually, two listening
# endpoints (the "plain" one and the "tls" one) are equivalent in terms of
# functionality; but we keep both endpoints to satisfy the RFC 5766 specs.
# For secure TCP connections, we currently support SSL version 3 and
# TLS version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.
# For secure UDP connections, we support DTLS version 1.

# Multiple relay addresses may be used.
# The same IP(s) can be used as both listening IP(s) and relay IP(s).
#
# If no relay IP(s) specified, then the turnserver will apply the default
# policy: it will decide itself which relay addresses to be used, and it
# will always be using the client socket IP address as the relay IP address
# of the TURN session (if the requested relay address family is the same
# as the family of the client socket).

# For Amazon EC2 users:
#
# TURN Server public/private address mapping, if the server is behind NAT.
# In that situation, if a -X is used in form "-X <ip>" then that ip will be reported
# as relay IP address of all allocations. This scenario works only in a simple case
# when one single relay address is be used, and no RFC5780 functionality is required.
# That single relay address must be mapped by NAT to the 'external' IP.
# The "external-ip" value, if not empty, is returned in XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS field.
# For that 'external' IP, NAT must forward ports directly (relayed port 12345
# must be always mapped to the same 'external' port 12345).
#
# In more complex case when more than one IP address is involved,
# that option must be used several times, each entry must
# have form "-X <public-ip/private-ip>", to map all involved addresses.
# RFC5780 NAT discovery STUN functionality will work correctly,
# if the addresses are mapped properly, even when the TURN server itself
# is behind A NAT.
#
# By default, this value is empty, and no address mapping is used.
